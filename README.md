### Setting Up Server API

Before running the application, you need to configure the server API URL in the `/src/data/url.js` file. Follow these steps:

1. Open the `/src/data/url.js` file in your code editor.
2. Depending on your environment, set the `server` variable to point to the API server URL. If you're deploying to GitHub Pages, use the Heroku URL. Otherwise, when using on local, use the local server URL.

```javascript
const isGitHubPages = window.location.hostname === 'your github url'
const heroku = 'your sever url'
const localServer = 'your local testing port'
const base = '/charlulushop-react'

const url = {
  server: isGitHubPages ? heroku : localServer,
  client: base,
}
export default url
```

### Running the Application

npm run dev
```

### Deploy the Application
